## Pipeline Integration for Deployment in AWS 

### (a) To an ec2 instance
* Create an ubuntu instance in aws
* Config the Credentials
```
Manage Jenkins > Manage Credentials 
Add Credentials
kind : SSH Username with private key
UserName : ubuntu (as per instance name)
Private Key (Enter Directlly) : Copy and paste the contents of key.pem file
```
* Config SSH Remote Hosts
```
Manage Jenkins > Config System >SSH Remote Hosts
Host Name : (Public IPv4 Adress of the Instance)
Port : 22 (Default for SSH Connections)
Credentials : ubuntu (as per name given in credentials above)
Check Connection and Save
```
* SSH Agent Test Validation
Try this in pipeline script of jenkins (if error arises during ssh connection)
```
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('test') {
            steps {
                sshagent(['73480030-7719-475d-8bb3-d7a4fc22c524']){
                    sh 'ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ubuntu@3.18.221.13 pwd'
                }
                
            }
        }
    }
}


OP : Warning: Permanently added '3.18.221.13' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts
```
* Copy ID generated by the credential and Finally run the pipeline

### (b) To a s3 bucket
* Create a bucket in AWS
* Creating An User
```
Go to IAM Management 
Add an User (if already not added)
Give permissions for Full Access for Amazon ec2 and Amazon s3
Dowmload the Credentials File
```
* Configure the Credentials
```
Manage Jenkins > Manage Credentials 
Add Credentials
kind : AWS Credentials
Access Key Id : Type in from the downloaded credentials file for user
Secret Access Key : Type in from the downloaded credentials file for user
```
* Save and copy ID generated by credential to integrate in pipeline



## Pipeline Script for Deployment
### For Local jenkins
```
 stage('aws deployment'){
            steps{
                script{
                    last_started=env.STAGE_NAME
                }
                sshagent(['f17813c1-8ef1-4fee-960e-74e7c6f7efcb']){
                    bat 'scp -r C:/Windows/System32/config/systemprofile/AppData/Local/Jenkins/.jenkins/workspace/ContinuousIntegrationPipeline/artifacts/*.jar ubuntu@3.18.221.13:/home/ubuntu/artifacts'
        }
            }
        } 
```

### For Jenkins on Docker
```
   stage('aws deployment'){
            steps{
                script{
                    last_started=env.STAGE_NAME
                }
                sshagent(['73480030-7719-475d-8bb3-d7a4fc22c524']){
                    sh 'scp -r /var/jenkins_home/workspace/ContIntegEmployee/artifacts/*.jar ubuntu@3.18.221.13:/home/ubuntu/artifacts'
        }
            }
        } 
```
